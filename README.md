# humble-3d-animations


This is another very humble experiment i built while studying basic computer graphics programming. This time i am struggling with skinning meshes and their animations. Models and animations are loaded from a GLTF file.


It is a very early version and has a lot of bugs, but this is the first version that "kinda works"... Hopefully i'm able to fix everything in the near future!


For the record, i learned a lot from  [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) and [Euclidean Space](http://www.euclideanspace.com/), among other resources scattered around the web.

The [model](https://blendswap.com/blend/7791) i'm using in this experiment was created by the user [pasilan](https://blendswap.com/profile/49770) and released under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). I also tried with some models and animations from [mixamo](http://mixamo.com/) with relative success


PS: Some browsers do not support floating point textures (which this experiment currently rely on). I'm looking to work around it, but meanwhile this MAY OR MAY NOT WORK!  xD
